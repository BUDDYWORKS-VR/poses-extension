# BUDDYWORKS Poses Extension for GoGo Loco

A neat extension for GogoLoco with plenty of poses for photography.

The Poses are all put into a singular animation clip and dialed in via a radial menu. This not only makes it way easier to maintain, it also allows you to easily add additional poses. Note that the more poses you have, the more difficult it will get to dial them in with the radial menu. The limit is probably 100.

# Dependencies:
- VRCFury

# Installation:
1. Add the Prefab to your scene via the Unity Toolbar. "BUDDYWORKS -> Poses Extension -> Spawn Prefab"
2. Make sure the Prefab is on your avatar.

That should be it, upload and use.

# Usage: 
Toggle the type of pose, and use the dial to select the desired pose.

# Add more poses:
The system comes with a couple example poses, mostly standing ones.
You can add more by editing the master clips in /Assets/BUDDYWORKS/Pose System/Poses/
Copy your animation keyframes at the end of the correct master clip, done!
