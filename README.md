# Dependencies
- VRCFury (For automated installation) (Recommended)
- GoGo Loco (For the GGL Variant)
- Write Defaults On only! (Funky setup sadly breaks in WD Off)

# Installation:
1. Import the package.
2. In the Toolbar, find BUDDYWORKS - Poses Extension.
3. Click “Spawn Prefab…”, whichever applies to you.  
*When in doubt, use the first option, it will always have the latest features.*

That should be it, upload and use.

# Usage: 
Toggle the type of pose, and use the dial to select the desired pose.
